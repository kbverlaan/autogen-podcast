And that was "Colder Weather" by the Zac Brown Band, a song that really showcases their knack for fusing country with a hint of rock and soul. Now, as we delve into the next era of their career, we see the band not just riding the wave of success, but also pushing their musical boundaries in some truly intriguing ways. 

One of the pivotal aspects of this evolution was their collaborations with other artists. For instance, they teamed up with Jimmy Buffett on the track "Knee Deep", and Alan Jackson on "As She's Walking Away". These partnerships not only infused a fresh perspective into their music but also opened up new avenues for them to explore musically. 

Speaking of "As She's Walking Away", it's worth noting that this song bagged them a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration. A well-deserved recognition, wouldn't you agree? [pause 2 seconds] It's a poignant song that encapsulates the essence of country music, with its deeply touching lyrics and soul-stirring melody. 

Now, let's shift our focus to their album "You Get What You Give". Released in 2010, this album was a testament to the band's evolution and maturity. It showcased a more refined sound, with a fusion of country, rock, and even reggae influences. The album was a commercial hit, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and the Top Country Albums charts. 

But let's get back to the music, shall we? Here's "Toes", a track from "You Get What You Give". This song is a perfect example of the band's ability to mix different genres to create a sound that's uniquely their own. [play: 'Toes' by Zac Brown Band]
