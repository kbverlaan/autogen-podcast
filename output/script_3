And that indelible mark, my friends, [pause 1 second] only deepened as we moved into the final years of The Beatles, from 1968 to 1970. [pause 1 second] This era was marked by internal conflict, sure, [pause 1 second] but also by incredible individual artistic growth. [pause 1 second]

Now, let's dive into the music that defined this period. [pause 1 second] First up, we have "Hey Jude" from 1968. [play: "Hey Jude" by The Beatles]

Ah, "Hey Jude". Such a classic, isn't it? [pause 1 second] Now, during this time, The Beatles also took a spiritual trip to India, [pause 1 second] which had a profound influence on their music and personal lives. [pause 1 second] 

In 1969, they released "Come Together", a track that truly encapsulates the spirit of the era. [play: "Come Together" by The Beatles]

"Come Together" is such a powerful anthem, isn't it? [pause 1 second] Now, 1969 was also the year of their iconic rooftop concert, [pause 1 second] a spontaneous live performance that has since become a legendary moment in rock history. [pause 1 second] 

And then, of course, there was the eventual breakup. [pause 1 second] But even in the midst of their internal struggles, they managed to create their final album, "Let It Be," which was released after their split in 1970. [pause 1 second] 

Speaking of "Let It Be", let's take a moment to appreciate this masterpiece. [play: "Let It Be" by The Beatles]

"Let It Be" is such a poignant farewell, don't you think? [pause 1 second] Now, during these final years, The Beatles also released "The White Album" in 1968 and "Abbey Road" in 1969. [pause 1 second] 

And let's not forget, they won a Grammy for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for "Abbey Road" in 1969. [pause 1 second] So, even as they were grappling with their own internal conflicts, The Beatles continued to push the boundaries of music and create timeless masterpieces. [pause 2 seconds] 

And that, my friends, is the true testament to their genius. [pause 2 seconds]
