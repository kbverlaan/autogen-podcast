These early years were a time of struggle, determination, and growth. They were just a bunch of kids, really, trying to make their mark in the bustling London music scene. They played in pubs, clubs, anywhere they could really, honing their skills and developing their unique sound. 

Now, what's interesting about The Rolling Stones is their deep-rooted love for American blues. Artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf were huge influences on their music. Can you hear that raw, gritty sound in their early tracks? That's the blues seeping through.
