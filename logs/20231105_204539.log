Now, as we delve deeper into the rich tapestry of Fleetwood Mac's history, we find ourselves at the very beginning, the Peter Green era. This was a time when the band was deeply rooted in the blues, a genre that would shape their sound and influence their music for years to come. 

[pause 1 second]

Peter Green, the band's original frontman, was a driving force during this era. His unique guitar style and soulful vocals set the tone for the band's early success. It was under his leadership that Fleetwood Mac produced some of their most iconic blues tracks.
