...and that, my friends, is how we find ourselves here, at the beginning of another exciting journey into the heart of music history. Welcome to Rhythm and Roots, I'm your host, Basilius, and I'm thrilled to be your guide on this musical expedition. 

Now, today, we're diving into the rich and tumultuous history of a band that needs no introduction... but I'm gonna give them one anyway. We're talking about Fleetwood Mac, folks. Formed in London in 1967, this band has seen more than its fair share of ups, downs, and everything in between. From their bluesy beginnings to their pop-rock dominance, Fleetwood Mac has evolved and adapted over the years, much like a musical chameleon... or maybe a phoenix, rising from the ashes of their own internal conflicts to create some of the most iconic songs of the 20th century. 

Pause for music: 'Go Your Own Way' by Fleetwood Mac.

Ah, that's a classic, isn't it? Now, here on Rhythm and Roots, we're all about digging deep. We're not just gonna skim the surface of Fleetwood Mac's history. Oh no, we're going to delve into the nitty-gritty, the behind-the-scenes drama, the creative process, and of course, the music itself. We'll explore how this band, against all odds, managed to stay together and produce hit after hit, even when they were at each other's throats. 

And to keep things interesting, we'll be sprinkling in some trivia questions throughout the podcast. So, if you're a Fleetwood Mac superfan, or even if you're just a casual listener, you'll have a chance to test your knowledge and maybe learn something new. 

Speaking of trivia, let's kick things off with a teaser question. Now, we all know that Fleetwood Mac has had a revolving door of band members over the years, but can you tell me who the only two constant members have been since the band's formation in 1967? Don't worry, I won't leave you hanging for too long. We'll reveal the answer later in the show. 

So, buckle up, folks. We're about to embark on a wild ride through the history of Fleetwood Mac. And trust me, it's gonna be a trip you won't want to miss.
