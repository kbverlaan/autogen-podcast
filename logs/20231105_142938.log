Basilius: "Pause for music: 'Go Your Own Way' by Fleetwood Mac. Ah, what a classic, right? Now, let's rewind a bit, shall we? Back to the very beginning, the early days of Fleetwood Mac. We're talking about the Peter Green era, from 1967 to 1970. 

Basilius: "Now, this was a time when the band was deeply rooted in blues. The key members during this era were Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie. These guys, they were the heart and soul of the band, and their influence, well, it's still felt today. 

Basilius: "Pause for music: 'Black Magic Woman' by Fleetwood Mac. And 'Albatross' by Fleetwood Mac. 

Basilius: "Ah, those were the days, huh? But, as we all know, all good things must come to an end. And so, in 1970, Peter Green decided to leave the band. This, of course, had a huge impact on Fleetwood Mac. 

Basilius: "Now, here's a little anecdote about Peter's departure. Apparently, he announced his decision to leave the band during a band meeting at a Chinese restaurant. Can you imagine? Over some sweet and sour pork, perhaps? 

Basilius: "And now, let's answer a fan question about this era. We have a question from Sarah in New York. She asks, 'Why did Peter Green leave the band?' Well, Sarah, it's a bit of a complex story. Peter was struggling with mental health issues and drug use, and he felt that he needed to step away from the music industry to focus on his health. 

Basilius: "So, there you have it, folks. The Peter Green era of Fleetwood Mac. A time of blues, band members coming and going, and, of course, some unforgettable music. But, as they say, the show must go on. And so, Fleetwood Mac continued on without Peter Green, and well, the rest is history. But we'll get to that later. For now, let's take a short break. When we come back, we'll dive into the next era of Fleetwood Mac. Stay tuned!"
