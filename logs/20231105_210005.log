[play: 'Go Your Own Way' by Fleetwood Mac]

Ah, 'Go Your Own Way', a classic Fleetwood Mac track that never fails to stir the soul. But to truly appreciate the depth and complexity of this band, we need to rewind to the very beginning. 

ERA 1: The Peter Green Era (1967-1970)

In the late 60s, a young guitarist named Peter Green formed Fleetwood Mac, and the band's early sound was steeped in the blues. Green's soulful guitar work and emotive vocals set the tone for the band's initial success. [pause 1 second] Let's take a listen to one of their early hits, a song that would later be famously covered by Santana. [play: 'Black Magic Woman' by Fleetwood Mac]

[play: 'Black Magic Woman' by Fleetwood Mac]

That was 'Black Magic Woman', a haunting blues number that showcases Green's masterful guitar work and songwriting prowess. But Green's influence didn't stop there. He also penned the instrumental 'Albatross', a track that soared to the top of the UK charts. [play: 'Albatross' by Fleetwood Mac]

[play: 'Albatross' by Fleetwood Mac]

The ethereal 'Albatross' is a testament to Green's versatility as a musician. But perhaps one of the most enduring songs from this era is 'Oh Well', a track that encapsulates the raw energy and experimental spirit of early Fleetwood Mac. [play: 'Oh Well' by Fleetwood Mac]

[play: 'Oh Well' by Fleetwood Mac]

'Oh Well' is a song that truly captures the essence of the Peter Green era. But as we know, all good things must come to an end. Green's departure from the band in 1970 marked the end of an era, but it also paved the way for a new chapter in Fleetwood Mac's history, one that would take them to even greater heights. But that, my friends, is a story for our next episode. Until then, keep the music playing and the rhythm flowing.
