Well, hello there, folks! This is your host, Basilius, and you're tuned into Rhythm and Roots, the podcast where we dig deep into the history of your favorite bands and musicians. 

Now, today, we're going to be talking about a band that's been around for quite some time, and boy, have they seen some changes. I'm talking about none other than Fleetwood Mac. 

Formed in 1967, Fleetwood Mac started as a British blues band, but over the years, they've evolved into a rock band with a pop edge. They've had a revolving door of members, with some leaving and then returning, and others leaving for good. But through it all, they've managed to create some of the most iconic music of the 20th century.
