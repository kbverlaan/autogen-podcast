Hello, hello, and welcome to Rhythm and Roots, the podcast where we delve into the stories behind the music that moves us. I'm your host, Basilius, and I'm thrilled to have you join me on this musical journey. Today, we're going to take a trip back in time, to the era of bell-bottoms, peace signs, and some of the most iconic music ever created. 

We're talking about the 1960s and 70s, a time when rock and roll was evolving, and a band named Fleetwood Mac was just beginning to make their mark on the world. Formed in London in 1967, Fleetwood Mac started as a blues band, with Mick Fleetwood on drums, John McVie on bass, Peter Green on guitar, and Jeremy Spencer also on guitar. 

Their early years were marked by a series of lineup changes, with members coming and going, but the core of the band, Fleetwood and McVie, remained constant. They had some success in the UK, but it wasn't until they added a couple of Americans to the mix, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, that they really started to take off. 

And take off they did. Their self-titled album in 1975, the first with Buckingham and Nicks, was a huge success, reaching number one on the Billboard charts. But it was their next album, Rumours, that really cemented their place in rock history. 

Speaking of Rumours, it's time to introduce our signature track for today's episode: "Go Your Own Way". This song, written by Lindsey Buckingham, is a raw and emotional breakup anthem that perfectly encapsulates the tumultuous relationships within the band at the time. It's a song that resonates with anyone who's ever had to walk away from something or someone, even when it hurts. 

So, let's take a moment to appreciate this classic track. 

Pause for music: 'Go Your Own Way' by Fleetwood Mac.

Ah, "Go Your Own Way". It's a song that never gets old, isn't it? Now, let's dive deeper into the story behind this iconic track and the band that created it.

Peter Green, a gifted guitarist and songwriter, was the driving force behind the band's early success. His influence was profound, shaping the band's sound and direction. [pause 1 second]

But as we know, all good things must come to an end. Peter Green's departure from the band in 1970 was a significant blow.

The band was left to navigate the choppy waters of the music industry without their guiding star. But as we'll see, this was just the beginning of their journey. [pause 1.5 seconds]
