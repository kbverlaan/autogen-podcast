Create an outline for a podcast that gives an introduction around the discography of Fleetwood Mac.

FRAMEWORK OF PODCAST
Their life should be divided up in different era's based upon the themes and events in their life. The music in the podcast should contain some of their big hits, but also play some lesser know gems. You can always mention hits, without playing them. In more prolific era's of the artists career, you can mention more tracks. The era's should be more of a guideline and are not explicitly mentioned in the podcast.
In total the podcast should contain about 10 tracks but it may vary. 
In total the speaking time should be around 20 minutes.

The speaking time is also well balanced with the music time, making the total podcast time around 1 hour. 

Cohesiveness: 9/10 - The outline flows logically from the band's formation to their current status. However, the transition between eras could be smoother. Consider adding a brief summary at the end of each era to link it to the next.

Engagement: 8/10 - The stories and music will engage listeners, but there could be more interactive elements. Perhaps include some trivia questions about the band or encourage listeners to share their favorite Fleetwood Mac songs or memories on social media.

Depth: 8/10 - The outline covers the band's history in depth, but it could delve deeper into the band members' personal lives and how they influenced their music.

Originality: 7/10 - While the outline is well-structured and comprehensive, it follows a fairly standard format for a music history podcast. To make it more original, consider including interviews with music experts or fans, or analyzing the band's lyrics and musical style in more detail.

Overall, this is a solid outline with a few areas for improvement. With some minor adjustments, it could be a highly engaging and informative podcast about Fleetwood Mac.
