But to truly appreciate the depth of Fleetwood Mac's music, we need to travel back in time, to the very beginning. The year was 1967, and a young guitarist named Peter Green was about to change the face of blues music forever.

Peter Green, a gifted musician with a unique vision, was the driving force behind Fleetwood Mac's early years. His influence on the band was profound, shaping their sound and setting the stage for their future success. Green's bluesy guitar riffs and soulful vocals gave Fleetwood Mac a distinctive edge, setting them apart from other bands of the era.

And speaking of Green's influence, let's dive into some of the music highlights from this era. First up, we have 'Black Magic Woman'. Now, you might be more familiar with the Santana version, but it was actually written by Peter Green for Fleetwood Mac. [play: 'Black Magic Woman' by Fleetwood Mac]

Ah, the haunting beauty of 'Black Magic Woman'. It's a testament to Green's songwriting prowess, isn't it? But that's not all. Next, we have 'Albatross', a track that showcases Green's ability to create atmospheric, almost hypnotic music. [play: 'Albatross' by Fleetwood Mac]

The ethereal 'Albatross' truly is a masterpiece, isn't it? It's a song that transports you to another place, another time. And finally, we have 'Oh Well', a track that perfectly encapsulates the raw energy and passion of the Peter Green era. [play: 'Oh Well' by Fleetwood Mac]

Listening to 'Oh Well', you can't help but feel the intensity of the band's early years. But as we all know, all good things must come to an end. In 1970, Peter Green left Fleetwood Mac, a departure that sent shockwaves through the music world. His exit marked the end of an era, but it also paved the way for a new chapter in the band's history, one that would see them reach even greater heights. But that's a story for another time. For now, let's just sit back and appreciate the genius of Peter Green and the indelible mark he left on Fleetwood Mac.
