Hey there, folks! Welcome back to another episode of our podcast. I'm your host, Basilius, and today we're diving into the world of a legendary duo that has left an indelible mark on the music industry. I'm talking about none other than Hall & Oates. 

Now, if you're a fan of rock and soul, you're probably already familiar with these guys. But even if you're not, I bet you've heard their music somewhere - in a movie, on the radio, or maybe even in your favorite coffee shop. That's the kind of impact they've had. They've managed to blend rock and soul in a way that's uniquely theirs, creating a sound that's both timeless and instantly recognizable. 

But before we get into all that, let me give you a quick rundown of what you can expect from today's episode. We're going to be exploring the journey of Hall & Oates, from their humble beginnings to their rise to stardom. We'll be talking about their biggest hits, their influences, and the legacy they've left behind. And of course, we'll be playing some of their most iconic tracks for you to enjoy.

So, whether you're a long-time fan or just curious about their music, stick around. We've got a lot to cover, and I promise you, it's going to be a fun ride. 

Now, let's kick things off with one of their biggest hits. This is a song that really showcases their unique blend of rock and soul. Pause for music: 'Rich Girl' by Hall & Oates.

[Music plays]

Ah, what a classic! That was 'Rich Girl' by Hall & Oates. Now, let's dive into their story, shall we?
