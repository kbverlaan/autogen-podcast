    Create an outline for a podcast that gives an introduction around the discography of Fleetwood Mac.

    FRAMEWORK OF PODCAST

The music in the podcast should contain some of their big hits, but also play some lesser know gems. You can always mention hits, without playing them.

    In total the podcast should contain about 10 tracks but it may vary. 
    In total the speaking time should be around 15 minutes.

basic_chat(): replied with: Cohesiveness: 9/10 - The outline follows a clear chronological order, which makes it easy to follow. However, the transition between sections could be smoother.

Engagement: 8/10 - The combination of music, stories, and discussion should keep listeners engaged. However, the time allocated to each section seems a bit short, especially for such a complex and storied band.

Depth: 7/10 - While the outline does cover the band's history, it could delve deeper into the band's music and the stories behind it. For example, the "Golden Era" section could be expanded to discuss more about the making of "Rumours" and the band's interpersonal relationships.

Music Choice: 9/10 - The chosen songs are representative of each era of Fleetwood Mac's career. However, it might be beneficial to include more lesser-known songs to showcase the band's range and evolution.

Originality: 8/10 - The format is fairly standard for a music podcast, but the focus on stories behind the music adds a unique touch.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Consider expanding the time for each section to allow for more in-depth discussion and storytelling.
2. Include more lesser-known songs to showcase the band's range and evolution.
3. Smooth out transitions between sections to improve the flow of the podcast.
