Ah, what a classic. "Go Your Own Way" really sets the tone for Fleetwood Mac's journey, doesn't it? But to truly appreciate the band's evolution, we need to rewind to the very beginning. The Peter Green era, from 1967 to 1970, was a time when the band was deeply rooted in the blues. 

Peter Green, the band's original frontman, was a phenomenal guitarist and songwriter. His influence on the band was profound, shaping their early sound and laying the groundwork for their future success. [pause 1 second] Green's unique blend of blues and rock, combined with his soulful voice, gave Fleetwood Mac its distinctive sound. 

During this era, the band produced some truly memorable tracks. "Black Magic Woman", for instance, is a hauntingly beautiful song that showcases Green's guitar prowess and his ability to craft deeply emotive lyrics. [pause 1 second] Then there's "Albatross", a dreamy instrumental piece that transports you to another world. And who could forget "Oh Well", a raw and powerful track that encapsulates the band's blues roots? [pause 1 second]

But let's take a moment to listen to these gems. First up, "Black Magic Woman". [play: "Black Magic Woman" by Fleetwood Mac]

Did you feel the magic? Now, let's drift away with "Albatross". [play: "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac]

And finally, let's dive into the raw energy of "Oh Well". [play: "Oh Well" by Fleetwood Mac]

Peter Green's departure from the band in 1970 was a significant turning point. His struggles with mental health and substance abuse led him to leave the band he had helped create. This departure had a profound impact on Fleetwood Mac, leading to a shift in their musical direction and the beginning of a new era. But that's a story for another time. For now, let's just appreciate the indelible mark Peter Green left on the band and the music world at large.
