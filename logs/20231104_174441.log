Create an outline for a podcast that gives an introduction around the discography of Fleetwood Mac.

FRAMEWORK OF PODCAST
Their life should be divided up in different era's based upon the themes and events in their life. The music in the podcast should contain some of their big hits, but also play some lesser know gems. You can always mention hits, without playing them. In more prolific era's of the artists career, you can mention more tracks. The era's should be more of a guideline and are not explicitly mentioned in the podcast.
In total the podcast should contain about 10 tracks but it may vary. 
In total the speaking time should be around 20 minutes.

basic_chat(): replied with: The outline is well-structured and covers the band's history in a comprehensive manner. However, the total time of music and speaking exceeds the 20-minute limit. The music time alone is approximately 42 minutes, which is more than double the desired time. 

Cohesiveness: 9/10 - The outline is well-structured and follows a logical timeline of the band's history. 

Engagement: 8/10 - The stories and music choices are engaging, but the length of the podcast may deter some listeners. 

Depth: 10/10 - The outline covers all the important eras of the band's history in depth. 

Music Choice: 10/10 - The chosen songs are representative of each era and are some of the band's most popular tracks. 

Originality: 8/10 - While the outline follows a standard format for a music history podcast, the focus on Fleetwood Mac's personal and professional struggles adds a unique element. 

Suggestions for improvement: 

1. Reduce the number of songs or shorten the length of the music clips to fit within the 20-minute timeframe. 

2. Consider adding a section on the band's influence on other artists and their legacy in the music industry. 

3. Include some interesting anecdotes or trivia about the band members to add more engagement and originality. 

4. In the conclusion, instead of just encouraging listeners to explore Fleetwood Mac's music further, you could suggest specific albums or performances to check out. 

5. You could also consider including some brief interviews or quotes from band members, if available, to add more depth and authenticity to the podcast.
