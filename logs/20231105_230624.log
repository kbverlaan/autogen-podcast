basic_chat(): replied with: Alright, folks, we're not slowing down just yet. We're barreling straight into the next chapter of Fleetwood Mac's epic journey. This is the time from 1987 to today, when the band saw some lineup changes but didn't skip a beat. 

Let's dive right into the music. We've got a trio of tracks that really define this time. We're talking "Everywhere", "Silver Springs", and "Say You Will". [play: 'Everywhere' by Fleetwood Mac, 'Silver Springs' by Fleetwood Mac, 'Say You Will' by Fleetwood Mac]

Wow, what a whirlwind of tunes, huh? Each one is a knockout, showcasing the band's knack for creating hits, despite the changes. From the catchy "Everywhere" to the haunting "Silver Springs" and the powerful "Say You Will", Fleetwood Mac continued to rock the charts.

But, you know, the music is just one part of the equation. The band's journey during this time was just as interesting. They got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a nod to their lasting impact on the music scene. And then there was the return of Christine McVie after a 16-year absence, which was a real treat for the fans.

In recent years, the band has kept the momentum going with tours and performances, proving that their music stands the test of time. So, as we delve deeper into the time from 1987 to today, let's remember that Fleetwood Mac's story is far from over. And what a ride it's been so far!
