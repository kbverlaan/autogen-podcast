basic_chat(): replied with: ...and there you have it, the song that started it all, "Go Your Own Way" by Fleetwood Mac. [pause 1 second] Now, let's journey back to the band's early days, to a time when Fleetwood Mac was a different beast altogether. We're talking about the Peter Green era, from 1967 to 1970.

This was a time when the band was deeply rooted in the blues, a genre that was the lifeblood of their music. Peter Green, the band's original frontman, was a driving force behind this bluesy sound. His guitar work was nothing short of magical, and his songwriting was deeply emotive, often reflecting the struggles and triumphs of his own life. 

Now, let's dive into some of the music highlights from this era. First up, we have "Black Magic Woman". Yes, you heard it right. Before Santana made it famous, it was a Fleetwood Mac original, penned by none other than Peter Green himself. [play: "Black Magic Woman" by Fleetwood Mac]

Coming back from that enchanting track, let's move on to "Albatross". This instrumental piece is a testament to Green's genius. It's a soothing, almost hypnotic track that showcases the band's ability to create a soundscape that transports you to another world. [play: "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac]

And who can forget "Oh Well"? This song is a perfect blend of blues and rock, with a raw energy that's hard to ignore. It's a testament to the band's versatility and Green's prowess as a songwriter. [play: "Oh Well" by Fleetwood Mac]

But as we all know, all good things must come to an end. Peter Green's departure from the band in 1970 was a significant blow. His struggles with mental health and substance abuse led him to leave the band he had helped create. This departure marked the end of an era, but it also paved the way for a new chapter in Fleetwood Mac's history, one that we'll explore in the next segment. But for now, let's take a moment to appreciate the profound impact Peter Green had on the band and the music world at large.
