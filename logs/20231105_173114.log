Pause for music: 'Go Your Own Way' by Fleetwood Mac

Alright, alright, alright... I hope you enjoyed that little musical interlude. Now, let's talk about a band that's been around the block a few times, shall we? I'm talking about none other than Fleetwood Mac. 

Formed in 1967, Fleetwood Mac started as a British blues band. Over the years, they've evolved, changed members, and even genres. From blues to rock to pop, they've done it all. And through all the changes, they've managed to stay relevant, producing hit after hit. 

Now, in this podcast, we're going to take a deep dive into the history of Fleetwood Mac, their music, and the stories behind their songs. We'll talk about their formation, their evolution, and the ups and downs they've faced over the years. We'll also delve into the personal lives of the band members, their relationships with each other, and how all of this influenced their music. 

So, if you're a fan of Fleetwood Mac, or if you're just curious about the stories behind some of the most iconic songs in music history, then you're in the right place. 

And to keep things interesting, I'll be throwing in some trivia questions throughout the podcast. Here's a little teaser for you... Can you name the only Fleetwood Mac album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart? Don't worry, I'll give you the answer later in the show. 

So, sit back, relax, and let's take a journey into the world of Fleetwood Mac...
