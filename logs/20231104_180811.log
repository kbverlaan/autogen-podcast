Create an outline for a podcast that gives an introduction around the discography of Fleetwood Mac.

FRAMEWORK OF PODCAST
Their life should be divided up in different era's based upon the themes and events in their life. The music in the podcast should contain some of their big hits, but also play some lesser know gems. You can always mention hits, without playing them. In more prolific era's of the artists career, you can mention more tracks. The era's should be more of a guideline and are not explicitly mentioned in the podcast.
In total the podcast should contain about 10 tracks but it may vary. 
In total the speaking time should be around 20 minutes.
