    Create an outline for a podcast that gives an introduction around the discography of Fleetwood Mac.

    FRAMEWORK OF PODCAST
    Their life should be divided up in different era's based upon the themes and events in their life. The music in the podcast should contain some of their big hits, but also play some lesser know gems. You can always mention hits, without playing them. In more prolific era's of the artists career, you can mention more tracks. The era's should be more of a guideline and are not explicitly mentioned in the podcast.
    In total the podcast should contain about 10 tracks but it may vary. 
    In total the speaking time should be around 20 minutes.

basic_chat(): replied with: Cohesiveness: The podcast outline flows logically, moving chronologically through the different eras of Fleetwood Mac's history. Each section includes an overview, music highlights, and stories, which provides a consistent structure.

Engagement: The outline is engaging, with a mix of music, stories, and historical context. The inclusion of specific songs and anecdotes will likely capture listeners' interest.

Depth: The content is substantial, covering the band's entire history from formation to the present day. Each era is given adequate time and attention.

Music Choice: The 10 tracks chosen are suitable and represent a wide range of Fleetwood Mac's discography. They include both well-known hits and lesser-known tracks, providing a comprehensive overview of the band's music.

Originality: The podcast is somewhat original in its chronological approach to the band's history, but the format is fairly standard for music history podcasts. 

Improvements: Consider adding a section for listener interaction, such as a Q&A or listener-submitted stories about Fleetwood Mac. This could increase engagement and make the podcast more unique. 

The speaking duration totals 22 minutes, which is slightly over the target. You might need to condense some sections to ensure a 20-minute speaking duration. The total duration with music is not specified, so it's unclear if it will reach the 1-hour mark. Please ensure each song's duration is accounted for in the total runtime.
